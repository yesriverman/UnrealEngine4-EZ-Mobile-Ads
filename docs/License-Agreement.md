  You can use the plugin for free, or you can also pay to get a license. Important, 
before using the plugin, please read the following content and accept the agreement. This will avoid potential trouble.

# 1. Win-win partnership
 if you don't have enough money yet to get a license, or don't have a PayPal account, here is another flexible option worth considering, no need to pay a cent. We may call it partnership.

We maintain, support, and version update for any plugin issues, you don't worry about its update or bugfix, just use it for free, and focus on your game logic.

Ship our code with yours to end-user, if it earns less than $1000 for you, no need paying a cent at all,
If it earns more then $1000 for you, instead, share very very little ad traffic (2%). Sharing ad traffic means that, when using my plugin to present the ad to user, random 2 out if 100, will use my ad unit, 98 use yours, so that we can both benefit and cover the cost of our effort.

Kindly reminder:
 If you have a high user traffic, please consider to get a license, it will be more cost-effective. Or else you might be unhappy someday.
 
# 2. Commercial

 If you are using this plugin in a commercial project, please get a licens, Or if you have used this plugin for FREE but 
monetized more than $1000, you are also required to get a license, or share us some Ad traffic. When a commercial license applies, 
there will be no more Ad traffic sharing, and 100% use your own Ad unit id. Pay $20 one time for a license to disable the ad sharing, 
to cover my maintenance and support effort. If you want to buy a license, please contact me by email:feixuwu@outlook.com
